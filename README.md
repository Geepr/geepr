# geepr
This is a top-level repository for Geepr.
As this app is organised in polyrepo, this one doesn't contain any actual code.
It does (or will...) contain files relevant to actual usage, like production ready docker files, as well as documentation and other readme.

## App

The Geepr app is made for managing your game collection on various platforms, as well as tracking playtime, release dates, and so on.
The current plan is for it to be mostly manual in nature, but integrations with other platforms (like Steam or HowLongToBeat) may or may not come in the future.

Right now it's mostly targetting individual users but I'm hoping to include at least some social featuers, like library sharing, along the way.

## Fair warning

This is a side-project of mine.
It may grow into a large, well-maintained application, but it can also be dropped at any time for any reason, like me getting bored of it.
